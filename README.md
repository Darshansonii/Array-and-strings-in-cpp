# Experiment 7: Arrays and Strings

## Aim
To perform various operations on arrays and strings such as:
1. Printing array elements
2. Searching for a number in an array
3. Calculating sum and average of array elements
4. Finding the minimum and maximum elements in an array
5. Declaring and initializing strings
6. Concatenating strings
7. Reversing a string
8. Checking for palindrome strings

## Theory

**Array:**  
An array is a collection of elements, all of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

Operations on arrays include:
- Traversing (printing elements)
- Searching (finding specific elements)
- Aggregation (sum and average)
- Comparison (minimum and maximum)

**String:**  
A string is a sequence of characters terminated by a null character (`\0`) in languages like C, or simply an object in high-level languages like Python and Java.

Common string operations include:
- Declaration and initialization
- Concatenation (joining two or more strings)
- Reversal
- Palindrome check (string reads the same forward and backward)

## Software Used

- Code Editor or IDE (such as Code::Blocks, Dev C++, VS Code, PyCharm)
- Programming Language Compiler or Interpreter:
  - C/C++
  - Python
  - Java
- Command Line/Terminal for input/output execution

## Conclusion

Through this experiment, we successfully implemented and understood fundamental operations on arrays and strings. We practiced how to manipulate array data, search and perform basic statistical operations. Additionally, we explored various string manipulations including concatenation, reversal, and checking for palindromes. These are essential concepts that build a strong foundation in problem-solving and algorithm development.
