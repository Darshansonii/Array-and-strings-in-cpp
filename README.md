# README: Array Operations in C++

## Aim

To implement and understand basic array operations in C++:

1. Printing array elements
2. Finding a specific number in a given array
3. Calculating the sum and average of array elements
4. Finding the minimum and maximum number in an array

## Software Used

* **IDE:** Code::Blocks / Dev C++ / Visual Studio / OnlineGDB
* **Compiler:** GCC / MSVC
* **Language:** C++17 or above

## Theory

Arrays are fundamental data structures in C++ that allow the storage of a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type. They are particularly useful when dealing with a large number of elements that can be processed using loops. Below are the concepts behind each task:

1. **Printing Array Elements:**
   Looping through an array using `for` or `while` allows access to each element by index. This is essential for debugging or displaying contents.

2. **Finding a Number in a Given Array:**
   A linear search is typically used, where each element is compared with the target value until it is found or the array ends.

3. **Sum and Average of Array Elements:**
   Iterating through the array while maintaining a running total lets us compute the sum. The average is derived by dividing the sum by the number of elements.

4. **Finding Minimum and Maximum Number:**
   Initializing `min` and `max` to the first element and updating them while traversing the array helps determine the smallest and largest values.

These operations lay the foundation for mastering more advanced data handling and algorithms in C++. Understanding how to work with arrays efficiently is crucial for problem-solving in both academic and real-world scenarios.

## Conclusion

The basic array operations provide a stepping stone to more advanced concepts in data structures. By mastering printing, searching, and calculating values in arrays, students build a strong foundation in C++ programming logic, loop constructs, and condition handling.
